Blackjack Simulation

To-Do List:
- implement system to enable variable bets across hands and push winnings/losses to bankroll
- implement system to enable doubling down on any player hand
- implement system to enable splitting pairs, creating new player hand
- consider metrics for performance tracking function
- write function that counts cards on table and across hands, provide to strategy functions
- create baseline player hand strategy function
- create baseline betting strategy function
- wrap all game components to simulate results of a play/bet strategy over many hands

Things to consider
- player object to have discrete instances of other opponents 
- money system like in max's version of the code
- Integrate the way max's cards get displayed
- create version to simulate games without user input
